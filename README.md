# Controller for individually controlable led strips

This library is for people wanting to try out different effects for their led strips, or program their own.

### Current progress
As of january 2024 this library is completly new and needs a lot of work.
I want to make a simple library for beginners wanting cool effects, as well as creative freedom for people wanting to program their own effects.
